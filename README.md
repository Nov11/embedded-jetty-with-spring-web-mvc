# embedded-jetty-with-spring-web-mvc

a minimal runnable embedded jetty web server with spring web mvc enabled.

* support filters
* support result converter
* support specified request content neogotiation
* beans created in app context can be wired into web controller


hope this may help those who are using jetty but missing old school web.xml config with tomcat.
